# Documentation for s8 measure

This measure quantifies the end-effector reaching accuracy for the robotic control.


### End-effector poses
The end-effector must reach 6 desired poses. The poses are defined by the locations depicted in the figure below and the rotation of the end-effector gripper  is fixed and pointing to the central location (i.e., end-effector gripper planes perpendicular to the central point).
